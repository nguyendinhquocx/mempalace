# MemPalace Recall Protocol

The canonical "search before answering" protocol shared across every
MemPalace integration (Cursor, Antigravity, Claude Code, Codex,
OpenClaw). This file is the single source of truth — skills and rules
should link here rather than restating the protocol, so the rule never
drifts from the skill.

The protocol exists to honour MemPalace's foundational promise:
**100% recall, verbatim, never guess.** When the palace might hold the
answer, the agent must read the palace before answering from model
memory.

## When to recall

Search the palace **before answering** whenever the user asks about
anything that may already be filed:

- Past work, prior decisions, or "what did we do / decide / try?"
- A person, project, or entity ("who is …", "what is …")
- Something that happened in an earlier session ("remember when …",
  "last time …", "the thing we discussed")
- A preference, fact, or relationship that could have changed over time

If the question is pure greenfield work with no memory relevance (e.g.
"rename this variable", "fix this typo"), do not search — recall is
question-driven, not reflexive.

## The protocol

1. **On wake-up** (if a session-start hook injected context, honour its wing scoping / `additional_context`): use the workspace's known wing for relevant recall; omit uncertain filters.
2. **Before responding** about people, projects, past events, or prior
   decisions: choose the recall tool that fits the question using
   [the query guide below](#retrieve-only-the-context-you-need). Start with
   KG for a known entity's relationships or time-bound facts, FIND for
   source text, or DIARY for recent agent continuity.
3. **If unsure** about a fact (name, age, relationship, preference): say
   "let me check the palace" and query. Wrong is worse than slow.
4. **Return verbatim.** Quote the drawer's exact stored words. Never
   summarize, paraphrase, or lossy-compress what the palace returns —
   that is the whole point of the system.
5. **After a substantive session**, record continuity with
   `palace_exec DIARY WRITE` or `mempalace_diary_write` (background hooks may already do this — do not
   double-file).
6. **When a fact changes**, choose the operation that preserves temporal
   history: use `palace_exec KG SUPERSEDE` (or `mempalace_kg_supersede`) for single-valued replacements
   (model, employer, owner, address, current status),
   `palace_exec KG INVALIDATE` (or `mempalace_kg_invalidate`) for facts that ended without replacement,
   and `palace_exec KG ADD` (or `mempalace_kg_add`) for independent/coexisting facts.

## Tool selection

| You need | Light MCP (Preferred) | Full MCP (Legacy) |
|---|---|---|
| Find any memory by meaning | `palace_query FIND <terms>` | `mempalace_search` |
| Relational / time-bound facts about an entity | `palace_query KG <entity>` | `mempalace_kg_query` |
| Replace a single-valued fact | `palace_exec KG SUPERSEDE` | `mempalace_kg_supersede` |
| The chronological story of an entity | `palace_query KG TIMELINE <entity>` | `mempalace_kg_timeline` |
| Recent session continuity | `palace_query DIARY <agent>` | `mempalace_diary_read` |
| Which wings / rooms exist (when scope unknown) | `palace_query WINGS`, `palace_query ROOMS` | `mempalace_list_wings`, `mempalace_list_rooms` |
| Record this session | `palace_exec DIARY WRITE` | `mempalace_diary_write` |

`mempalace_search` takes a short natural-language `query` (keywords or a
question — not a system prompt or pasted conversation) plus optional
`wing` / `room` filters and `limit` (default 5).

## Retrieve only the context you need

Start with the tool that fits the question and **stop when the result
answers it**. Progressive disclosure means retrieving more context only
when needed, rather than calling KG, search, and diary on every question.

1. **Known relationships or time-bound facts:** start with
   `palace_query KG <entity>` / `mempalace_kg_query(entity=...)`.
   For example, "Who owned myapp in March?" needs a known entity and an
   `as_of` date. Without `as_of`, the full MCP response includes active,
   historical, and future facts; use `active_facts` for a current-state
   question. If the relevant fact answers the question, stop. If the KG
   is empty or insufficient, search the stored text: not every memory
   has a corresponding KG fact.
2. **Decisions, explanations, or exact source words:** use
   `palace_query FIND <terms>` / `mempalace_search` with a short query
   and a small `limit`, such as 3. Start here directly for "Why did we
   switch databases?" Use `wing` / `room` only when their names are known
   and relevant. If a scoped search misses, check the taxonomy or relax
   those filters before concluding the information is absent. Search
   already returns stored text; retrieve a specific drawer when you need
   its complete content, including a logical drawer split into chunks.
3. **Recent agent continuity:** use `palace_query DIARY <agent>` /
   `mempalace_diary_read(agent_name=..., last_n=3)` for "Where did this
   agent leave off?" or a recent handover. A diary read can be the first
   call for this question; a fact lookup does not require one. The full
   MCP tool reads recent diary rows newest first, across the agent's
   wings unless `wing` is supplied. A row may be one chunk of a longer
   entry, so a small `last_n` does not promise complete sessions. Search
   for older or topic-specific context rather than assuming recent diary
   rows cover it.

Use source context when a structured fact needs explanation or
verification, and keep quoted text verbatim. Response sizes depend on
the number of facts and the length of stored text; a small result limit
does not impose a fixed token budget.

## Unhappy paths

- **Empty results.** An empty KG query or filtered search does not prove
  the palace has nothing on this. Try the appropriate text search or
  check and widen the scope. If recall still finds nothing, state what
  was checked; do not invent an answer to fill the gap. Offer to file
  the new information.
- **MCP unavailable / tool error.** Surface the error plainly and suggest
  the user verify the server (`mempalace status`, or re-run install).
  Do not silently fall back to guessing from model memory.
- **Palace index corrupt / compactor error.** When the server returns an
  error mentioning the HNSW segment writer, a ChromaDB compaction
  failure, or a stuck "Not connected" state after a write, the on-disk
  vector index is out of sync with `chroma.sqlite3` — but the drawer rows
  are intact in SQLite. Recover by rebuilding the index from SQLite, not
  by re-mining. See "Recovering a corrupt index" below. Do not attempt an
  in-process repair from the agent; guide the user to run the CLI.
- **Stale or conflicting facts.** Prefer the knowledge graph's
  time-valid answer. Use `mempalace_kg_supersede` for single-valued replacements,
  `mempalace_kg_invalidate` for facts that ended without replacement,
  and `mempalace_kg_add` for independent/coexisting facts.

## Recovering a corrupt index

A ChromaDB compaction failure can leave the drawers HNSW index out of
sync with `chroma.sqlite3` and wedge the MCP server (every call returns
"Not connected"). The data is safe in SQLite; rebuild the index from it.
Guide the user through these CLI steps — never run an in-process rebuild
from the agent (it can break other live clients):

1. Stop the MCP server (kill the `mempalace-mcp` process, or restart the
   host editor).
2. Optional backup of the palace directory (`--archive-existing` already
   moves the old palace aside, so this is belt-and-suspenders):
   - macOS / Linux: `cp -a ~/.mempalace/palace ~/.mempalace/palace.bak.$(date +%F)`
   - Windows (PowerShell): `Copy-Item -Recurse "$env:USERPROFILE\.mempalace\palace" "$env:USERPROFILE\.mempalace\palace.bak"`
3. Rebuild from SQLite:
   `mempalace repair --mode from-sqlite --archive-existing --yes`
4. Verify: `mempalace repair-status` (divergence should read 0).
5. Restart the MCP server.

Do **not** re-mine from source files to recover: re-mining drops drawers
added through the MCP server and diary entries, which have no source file
(see MemPalace issue #1843).

## Anti-patterns

- Answering about past work, people, or decisions from model memory when
  the palace might know — search first.
- Paraphrasing or summarizing stored content instead of quoting it
  verbatim.
- Searching reflexively on every turn, including pure greenfield coding
  with no memory relevance.
- Pasting the full conversation or a system prompt into the `query`
  argument — keep queries short and keyword-driven.
